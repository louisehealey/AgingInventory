# Aging Inventory
This Power BI report analyzes aging inventory by categorizing total cost and stock quantities into time-based buckets.These buckets allow users to track stock movement, identify slow-moving items, and optimize inventory turnover to improve efficiency and reduce waste.

Since most components are not serialized, tracking individual part movement is a challenge. To estimate how long stock has remained at the facility, this report leverages Purchase Order Transactions and assumes a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) inventory management approach.
